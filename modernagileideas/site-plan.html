      <div>This site is to help anyone interested in modern agile to understand some of the basics. </div>
      <div>The Modern Agile badge encapsulates the four principles of Modern Agile. </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>The horizontal elements from the badge are Experiment and Learn Rapidly & Deliver Value Continuously.</div>
      <ul>
        <li>The horizontal elements primarily represent the mechanics of the modern agile process.</li>
        <li>Experiment and Learn Rapidly speaks to the requirement to try new things and always improve.</li>
        <li>Deliver value Continuously speaks to the requirement to actually get work done and deliver something that
          adds value.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>The Vertical elements from the badge are Make People Awesome and Make Safety a Prerequisite.</div>
      <ul>
        <li>The vertical elements primarily represent the human factor of the modern agile process.</li>
        <li>Make People Awesome refers to both those who are working on the code as well as our customers.</li>
        <li>The goal is always to make people Awesome or at least more awesome than they were.</li>
      </ul>
      <div>Make Safety a Prerequisite is the element that recognizes we need to feel safe if we are going to do our best
        work.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>Each of the following pages will contain some ideal ways to implement each of these dimensions and values.
      </div>
      <div>Each page will also talk about how the Transformers Automation Team at AdvancedMD is currently implementing
        these principles.</div>

    <h3>Horizontal Experiment And Learn Rapidly & Deliver Value Continuously</h3>
    <div>The horizontal aspect of the Modern agile badge represents primarily the mechanics and the product we are
      trying to produce.</div>
    <div>The Although all the values work together the horizontal values are designed to focus on the how of building
      the product.</div>
    <div>Experiment and Learn Rapidly is the first of the horizontal values.</div>
    <div>Experimentation is an essential part of agile software development.</div>
    <div>Experimentation provides the following advantages.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to try things to make customers awesome.</li>
      <li>The ability to build software with your desired quality attributes.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Learn Rapidly is the second part it provides.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Emphasizes that Experimentation is designed to be iterative in short but meaningful cycles</li>
      <li>Experimentation without learning is not adding value even if you are learning what not to do learning is an
        essential part of the process.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Deliver Value Continuously is the second of the horizontal values.</div>
    <div>Delivery is the first element.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>To add value you have to deliver.</li>
      <li>You don't have to deliver everything just something.</li>
      <li>What you deliver should work.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Value is what we are intended to deliver.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Value means you give something that people find useful.</li>
      <li>It again isn't necessarily all the value but enough value that people could see how they would use it.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Continuously is how we deliver.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>At every opportunity we should deliver.</li>
      <li>This implies Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration (CI/CD)</li>
      <li>Delivering in a just in time manner puts value in front of people and allows us to begin to adjust.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vertical Make People Awesome & Make Safety a Prerequisite</h3>
    <p>
    <div>The vertical aspect of the Modern Agile badge represents primarily the human element of the product we are
      trying to produce.</div>
    <div>The Although all the values work together the vertical values are designed to focus on the humanity of building
      a product.</div>
    <div>Make People Awesome is the first of the vertical values.</div>
    <div>This is a broad value that requires you to think who am I trying to make awesome and what can I do to make them
      awesome.</div>
    <div>The people to be made awesome are everyone involved in the software including customers, stakeholders, and the
      team.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Awesomeness means different things to different people in the process.</li>
      <li>Customers are made awesome whenever you provide the ability to do something they were unable to do before or
        do it in a better way.</li>
      <li>Stakeholders become awesome when they get the value they are looking for in their domain of work.</li>
      <li>Teams are made awesome when they enjoy their work and feel a sense of accomplishment.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Make safety a priority is the second of the vertical values.</div>
    <div>Who needs to be safe? Everyone.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Safety is a priority when team members are allowed to make mistakes and correct them.</li>
      <li>Safety is a priority when customers can rely on the code to not do bad things to them.</li>
      <li>Safety is a priority when stakeholders know they will be protected from losing value.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>Making safety a priority can mean all of these things and more. It involves.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality</li>
      <li>Trust</li>
      <li>Freedom</li>
      <li>Honesty</li>
      <li>Diligence</li>
